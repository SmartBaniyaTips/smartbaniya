This process could take **weeks** — and cost you a fortune.

But now, **AI tools** have completely changed the game.  
With platforms like **Canva**, **Midjourney**, **Microsoft Designer**, and many others, you can create professional-quality designs yourself — without a design degree — in just a few clicks.
