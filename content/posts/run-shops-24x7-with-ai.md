## Why I Needed Automation

Let me share a quick backstory.

I used to run a small electronics shop. Business was good—but I was **tired of missing customer calls**, **answering the same questions again and again**, and **not being available 24x7**. Hiring staff was too expensive, and I didn't want to lose control.

So I thought: **“Why not use AI to help me run things?”**

That decision changed everything.

## Tool #1: WhatsApp AI Chatbot (using WATI or Zoko)

**What it does:** Replies to customers on WhatsApp automatically with prices, product info, store timings, etc.

### How I used it:
1. Created a free WhatsApp Business Account.
2. Connected it with **WATI** (or you can use **Zoko**).
3. Set up auto-replies for common questions like:
   - "Store timing?"
   - "Do you have this product?"
   - "How much is the price?"
4. The bot replied instantly—even while I was sleeping!

### Step-by-step:
- Visit [wati.io](https://wati.io)
- Sign up with your WhatsApp Business number.
- Use their chatbot builder to create flows (drag-and-drop style).
- Set welcome message, quick replies, and product menus.

This alone **saved me 2–3 hours daily.**

### How I used it:
1. Created a Google Form with:
   - Name
   - Product Name
   - Quantity
   - Address
2. Connected the form to Google Sheets.
3. I got email alerts instantly on new orders.

### Step-by-step:
- Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com)

**What it does:** Writes smart email replies using AI.

### How I used it:

**What it does:** Answers incoming calls with AI voice, gives product info, takes voicemail.

### How I used it:
1. Got a virtual business number via **OpenPhone**.
2. Set up an AI auto-attendant.
3. Now if someone calls, they hear:
   > “Welcome to Smart Baniya Shop! For prices, visit our website. To talk to support, press 1.”

### Step-by-step:
